## Context
1. Create database projects
2. Set up Entity Framework Core
3. Implement basic migrations
4. Configure multi-tenant data access foundation
## Prompt
Extend the solution with database infrastructure:

1. Add EduSuite.Database project
2. Create initial Entity Framework Core context
3. Implement basic tenant isolation at database level
4. Set up migration infrastructure
5. Add basic health checks
6. Include integration tests for database access

Focus on:
- Tenant ID column strategy
- Base entity classes
- Migration scripts
- Connection string handling
- Basic repository pattern implementation

## Observations
- It was able to generate the project and the context
- It was able generate the entities, but the some of the entity properties might not be required. Perhaps if I were specific about the properties, it would have generated the entities with the required properties only.
- The test projects were generated but the dependent packages were not properly updated so I had to manually update them.
