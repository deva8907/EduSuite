## Context
1. Tenant CRUD operations
2. Tenant configuration management
3. Tenant validation
4. API endpoints for tenant management

## Prompt
Implement tenant management API endpoints:

1. Create TenantController with CRUD operations
2. Implement tenant DTOs and mapping
3. Add tenant validation rules
4. Create tenant configuration endpoints
5. Implement tenant service layer
6. Add integration tests for tenant API

Include:
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Tenant configuration options
- API documentation

## Observations
- It created all endpoints, services and repositories but kept the changes inside a separate folder. I had to prompt to move them to the project folder. Perhaps I should have been more specific about where to put the changes
- I had to add the project dependencies of Api service and a nuget package for testing to the test project
- Very good in writing tests for the endpoints. Faced few issues but it was able to fix them with few prompts.
