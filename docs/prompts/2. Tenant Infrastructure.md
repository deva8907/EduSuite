## Context
1. Tenant entity and configuration
2. Tenant resolution middleware
3. Tenant service implementation
4. Tenant context accessor

## Prompt
Implement core tenant infrastructure:

1. Create TenantEntity base class
2. Implement ITenantContext interface and service
3. Add tenant resolution middleware
4. Create tenant configuration entities
5. Add tenant validation attributes
6. Include unit tests for tenant services

Requirements:
- Tenant header parsing
- Tenant validation
- Scoped tenant context
- Integration with EF Core

## Observations
- It was able to generate the tenant entity configuration entities, middleware, service and context accessor.
- The test projects depend on the implementation projects, this reference was not automatically updated. I had to manually update it.
- The database health check was generated but the dependent packages were not properly updated so I had to manually update them.
- It added middleware configurations to the database project, I had to prompt to move it to Api project
